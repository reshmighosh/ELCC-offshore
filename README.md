# Effective Load Carrying Capability-offshore

This repository conatains work from my research to understand the impacts of large renewable energy penetration on the future grid of New York in a stochastic way. The method used here is Effective Load Carrying Capability which involves both deterministic and probabilistic (depending on fuel type, i.e., conventional or weather dependent clean energy resources) process of understanding the contribution of a new generator (power plant) to the existing base fleet.
