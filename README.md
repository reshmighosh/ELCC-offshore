# Effective Load Carrying Capability-offshore

ELCC offshore is a python based tool to quantify teh Effective Load Carrying Capability or ELCC of offshore wind farms for the U.S. This work is a significant extension to the work by [M.Craig et al.](https://github.com/ijbd/elcc). ELCC is a metric to determine the contribution of a new generator to the existing base fleet of generators towards meeting electricity demand shortfall. Offshore wind farms in the US are still being planned, while the smooth integraion of renewable energy sources in the grid to increase reliability remains an area of study, due to the intermittent nature of solar and wind resources. Thus, we fill this research gap by simulating the contribution of offshore wind farms towards meeting demand, and spatially analyze the effect of placing offshore wind farms at one location vs. the other.

Through this tool, we aim to serve the stakeholders involved with the planning and commissioning of offshore wind farms, to gain a deep understanding of the contribution of offshore wind farms from a reliability standpoint. We define reliability as per the suggested method by [NERC](https://www.nerc.com/comm/PC/Probabilistic%20Assessment%20Working%20Group%20PAWG%20%20Relat/Probabilistic%20Adequacy%20and%20Measures%20Report.pdf), that is ability of a system to meet demand at all times except for 2.4 hours in a year (Loss of Load Hours).

This repository is a collection of my doctoral work to understand the impacts of large renewable energy penetration on the future grid of New York in a stochastic manner. ELCC involves both deterministic and probabilistic methods (depending on fuel type, i.e., conventional or weather dependent clean energy resources).
